# 🌸 FloraQuest 

FloraQuest is a modern web application for plant recognition, environmental data visualization, and interactive storytelling. Built with React and Vite, it leverages machine learning models for plant identification and provides a rich user experience with maps, charts, and camera integration.

## 🗺️ Features

- **Plant Recognition**: Identify plants using on-device ML models (TFLite) and a simple camera interface.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize geolocated data points and environmental layers.
- **Charts & Data Visualization**: Explore time series and environmental data with interactive charts.
- **Story Mode**: Engage with educational stories about nature and biodiversity.
- **Feed**: Browse recent activity and discoveries.

## 🧭 Usage
- Use the navigation menu to explore features: Map, Camera, Charts, Feed, Story, and About.
- Try the Camera page to identify plants using your device's camera.
- Explore the Map and Charts for environmental data.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- TFLite models for plant recognition are located in `public/models/`.
- Labels and model files are included for both plant detection and recognition.

## 🗂️ Folder Overview
